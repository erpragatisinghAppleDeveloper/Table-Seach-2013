Table Seach 2013
================

Example of how to search a UITableView in iOS 5, iOS 6 and iOS 7.

I've been pulling my hair out how to do this and finally worked it out. You can read a step by step guide here:

I've also added ways to initially hide the search bar, and hide it again when the user is finished searching as explained here:

iOS 7 Update
------------
Thanks to Janos Homoki, hiding and showing also works great under iOS 7.

Enjoy!
