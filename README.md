Table Seach 2013
================

Example of how to search a UITableView in iOS 5 and iOS 6

I've been pulling my hair out how to do this and finally worked it out. You can read a step by step guide here:

I've also added ways to initially hide the search bar, and hide it again when the user is finished searching as explained here:

iOS 7 Update:
The hiding/showing no longer works, so I've updated this project to only show/hide when the user is running iOS 5 or 6. On iOS 7, the search bar is always visible and the search button is hidden by default.

Enjoy!
