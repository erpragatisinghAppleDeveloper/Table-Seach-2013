You can read a step by step guide here:\r\n\r\nhttp://wpguru.co.uk/2013/02/how-to-create-a-searchable-uitableview/\r\n\r\nI've also added ways to initially hide the search bar, and hide it again when the user is finished searching as explained here:\r\n\r\nhttp://wpguru.co.uk/2013/03/how-to-hide-and-show-the-uisearchbar-in-a-uitableview/\r\n\r\niOS 7 Update\r\n------------\r\nThanks to Janos Homoki, hiding and showing also works great under iOS 7.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
